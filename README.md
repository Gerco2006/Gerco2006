# Hey! I'm Gerco 👋

I’m an aspiring Dutch train driver living in the Netherlands. I’ve always been interested in urban planning, public transport, and pretty much anything tech-related.  
I use GitHub to mess around with small projects I work on in the background, and for my main one — **TravNL (Project Groene Koek)**.

### TravNL (Project Groene Koek)

It’s a Dutch travel planner kinda like the NS or 9292 app, but built by me and it's community  
It uses the **NS API** for departure times and planning trips, aimed towards travelers and rail hobbyists and want more than just a simple travel planner

### Stuff I Use
- TypeScript / JavaScript / HTML / CSS  
- React
- Linux Fedora (Bazzite) as my main OS  
- I like playing around with APIs, UI stuff, and looking around in Open-source projects

---

### A bit about me
- Full-time student, aiming to become a train driver 
- I travel a lot by train (of course)  
- Usually got some **vinyl** spinning in the background when I’m programming or gaming
- Been using **Linux** since 2024 and don't regret a single thing about it

---

That’s about it — just me doing random projects for fun and learning along the way
